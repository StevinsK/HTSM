        <h1>What is Diabetes?</h1>
        <p>A metabolic abnormality that results in the alteration of insulin action, leading to poorly controlled sugar levels in the body, usually causing high glucose levels in the blood.</p>
        <p>The goal of management is to maintain the levels of sugars to near normal.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Definition of Terms:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hyperglycemia:</strong> - blood glucose level higher than normal</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypoglycemia:</strong> - blood glucose level lower than normal</li>
                    <li><strong>Fasting blood glucose:</strong> sugar level measured after fasting for a certain period (such as overnight)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Types of Diabetes Mellitus:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type 1 DM:</strong> - results in complete or near-total lack of insulin, requiring lifetime insulin administration</li>
                    <li><strong>Type 2 DM:</strong> - a group of disorders characterized by variable degrees of insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose production</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The expected values for normal fasting blood glucose concentration are between 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).</p>
        <p>When fasting blood glucose is between 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L), changes in lifestyle and monitoring glycemia are recommended. If fasting blood glucose is 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, diabetes is diagnosed.</p>
        <p>An individual with low fasting blood glucose concentration (hypoglycemia) – below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) – will experience <em>dizziness, sweating, palpitations, blurred vision</em>, and other symptoms that have to be monitored and corrected.</p>
        <p>Increased fasting blood glucose concentration (hyperglycemia) is an indicator of a higher risk of diabetes.</p>
        <p>Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are preceded by a period of progressive worsening of glucose homeostasis, followed by the development of hyperglycemia.</p>

        <h2>Overview of Type 1 DM (diabetes of early/childhood/juvenile onset)</h2>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes affects approximately 5% to 10% of all people with diabetes. It usually has an acute onset before 30 years of age and is characterized by destruction of the pancreatic beta cells due to a combination of genetic, immunological, epigenetic, and environmental factors. In genetically susceptible children, compliance to early infant feeding is a possible way to reduce type 1 diabetes.</p>
        <p>Although the events that precipitate beta-cell destruction are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that a genetic susceptibility is a common underlying factor in the development of type 1 diabetes. People do not inherit type 1 diabetes itself; rather, they inherit a <b>genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes</b>, which might be triggered by environmental factors.</p>
        <p>The destruction of the beta cells results in decreased insulin production, unchecked glucose production by the liver, and fasting hyperglycemia. In addition, glucose derived from food cannot be stored in the liver and remains in the bloodstream, contributing to postprandial (after meal) hyperglycemia.</p>
        <p>If the concentration of glucose in the blood exceeds the renal threshold for glucose, usually 9 to 11 mmol/L, the kidneys may not reabsorb all of the filtered glucose, and glucose appears in the urine (glucosuria). When excess glucose is excreted in the urine, it is accompanied by excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes, which is called <b>osmotic diuresis</b>. Insulin inhibits <i>glycogenolysis</i> and <i>gluconeogenesis</i>. In people with insulin deficiency, these processes are not restrained and contribute to hyperglycemia. In addition, the breakdown of fatty acids results in increased production of ketone bodies, which lead to <i>ketoacidotic states</i> and death if the insulin deficiency is not corrected.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview of DM type 2 (diabetes of late onset)</h2>
        <p>Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 90% to 95% of people 
            with diabetes. It occurs more commonly among people who are older than 30 years and obese. </p>
            <p>Incidence is rapidly increasing in 
            younger people because of the growing epidemic of obesity 
            in children, adolescents and young adults.</p> 
            <p>The two main insulin-related problems 
            related in type 2 diabetes are <b>insulin resistance</b> and <b>impaired 
            insulin secretion</b>. Insulin resistance refers to reduced tissue 
            sensitivity to insulin. ie, the body is producing insulin, but the body is not sensitive to it.</p>
            <p>Normally, insulin binds to insulin receptors on cell surfaces to enable glucose to enter 
                the cells where it is metabolised for energy or stored for later 
                use. This process does not occur or occurs poorly in type 2 diabetes and glucose does not enter the cells 
                and instead accumulates in the blood.</p> <P>Additionally, <i>Gluconeogenesis</i> in 
                the liver contributes to hyperglycaemia. <i>(Gluconeogenesis) is the process of producing glucose by the liver,
                    and this process is inhibited by insulin, thus, deficit of insulin in liver cause more glucose production by
                     liver.)</i> </P>             
            
                    <P>  High free glucose levels induces inflammation and oxidation and leads to the development of reactive oxygen 
                 
                species (free radicals) and other metabolic processes such as the formation of advanced glycated end-products that lead to tissue damage and diabetes 
                                complications. Glucose levels flactutions/instability (acute fluctuations in blood glucose) contributes
                 to <em> hyperglycemia and 
                oxidative stress.</em><P>Combination of genetic and environmental 
                factors plays a role. Environmental factors include lower socioeconomic 
                group, ethnicity and smoking.</P>
                <p>The beta cells secrete extra insulin to overcome insulin 
                    resistance,and hyperglycaemia in attempt to maintain the blood 
                    glucose level in the normal range. Thus, insulin levels are 
                    often abnormally high in the early stages of type 2 diabetes 
                    (hyperinsulinaemia). However, the beta cells cannot keep up 
                    with the increased demand for insulin over the long term; the blood glucose level rises above normal, and 
                    type 2 diabetes develops (or worsens).</p>
                    <p>The overworking beta cells (cells that produce insulin) causes a slow progressive beta cell loss 
                        and glucose intolerance; thus, type 2 diabetes may go undetected for many years. If symptoms are experienced, they are 
                        frequently mild and may include fatigue, irritability, polyuria (production of large amount of urine and frequent urination), 
                        polydipsia (excessive thirst that cause intake of large amount of water), skin wounds that heal slowly, vaginal infections 
                        and vision changes. However, type 2 diabetes and its complications often occur with few, if any noticeable symptoms; 
                        thus, it is often referred to as 'the silent killer.'The silent nature 
                        of type 2 diabetes has implications for psychological adjustment to and acceptance of diabetes</p>
                    <h3> The difference between type 1 and type 2</h3>
                    <p>No insulin production in type 1 DM, thus manifested by severe effects of acute complications like spiking high
                        blood sugars, over a short period of time, and formation of ketone bodies (ketones formation is inhibited by insulin, thus total
                        absence of insulin of type 1 DM leads to frequent coma from DKA - diabetic Ketoacidosis).
                    </p>
                    <p>Despite the impaired insulin secretion that is characteristic 
                        of type 2 diabetes, there is enough insulin present to prevent 
                        ketone bodies from forming except in specific circumstances 
                        such as overwhelming septicaemia(severe infections) and Ml (acute heart attack) with significant 
                        heart muscle damage. Therefore, DKA is uncommon in type 2 
                        diabetes. Instead, progressive rising uncontrolled hyperglycemia over time, causes dehydration, 
                        and diabetic coma of HHS (hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state) and patients are mainly admitted to hospital due to this acute 
                        condition for fluid replacement and lowering blood sugars to normal. Here, insulin is required untill HHS resolves 
                        and the patient is discharged with oral medications</p>
                        <p>Approximately 75% of type 2 diabetes is detected incidentally during routine laboratory investigations,
                             when ophthalmoscopic examinations are performed or when the person is 
                            admitted to hospital for another reason such as Ml. One consequence of undetected diabetes is that 
                            long-term diabetes 
                            complications such as eye disease, peripheral neuropathy (lack of/abnormal sensations of hands and legs)
                            and cardiovascular disease often develop 1 O to 15 years 
                            before diabetes is diagnosed</p>
                            <h4>Other types of diabetes</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Gestational Diabetes:  - <p>is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance occurring during 
                                    pregnancy. Hyperglycaemia develops during pregnancy because the placental 
                                    hormones cause insulin resistance.</p> <p>GDM occurs in up to 3% to 
                                    8% of pregnant women and increases the risk of adverse outcomes for the mother and baby. However, both the mother 
                                    and baby are at risk of type 2 diabetes in later life. </p><p>The risk 
                                    factors for GDM are similar to the risk factors for type 2 diabetes.</p>
                                <p>Initial management includes dietary modification, regular 
                                    activity and blood glucose monitoring. If hyperglycaemia 
                                    persists, insulin is prescribed. Oral hypoglycaemic agents are 
                                    generally not used during pregnancy, although metformin is 
                                    used in some countries</p>
                                    <p>After delivery, blood glucose levels in women with GDM 
                                        usually return to normal. Because women with GDM are at 
                                        high risk of type 2 diabetes, they should be counselled to 
                                        maintain their ideal body weight, exercise regularly and have 
                                        regular health check-ups. It is also 
                                        important that their blood glucose levels are measured at the 
                                        postnatal follow-up visit. </p>

                                    <li>Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA): - 
                                        <P>Occurs in 
                                            about 10% of people with diabetes. LADA has features of 
                                            type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is a genetically linked autoimmune disorder
                                             but has a slower onset than type 1 
                                            diabetes and people are often initially diagnosed with type 
                                            2 diabetes. The prevalence of LADA varies among ethnic 
                                            groups. People with LADA are usually older, are 
                                            not overweight and require insulin in a relatively short time 
                                            after diagnosis.

                                    <li>Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY): - <P>is a rare type 
                                        of diabetes caused by a mutation in a number of different 
                                        genes, the most common being the GCK and HNF1A genes. 
                                        MODY is usually diagnosed in late childhood, adolescence or 
                                        early adulthood but can present in adults up to their late 50s. 
                                        Many people with MODY are misdiagnosed with type 1 or
