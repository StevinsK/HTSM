    <h1>What is diabetes?</h1>
    <p>A metabolic abnormality that results in the alteration of insulin action, leading to poorly
         controlled sugar levels in the body, usually causing high glucose levels in blood.</p>
        <p>The goal of management is to maintain the levels of sugars to near normal</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Defination of terms:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hyperglacaemia:   -  blood glucose level higher than normal</li>
                    <li>Hypoglacaemia:   -  blood glucose level lower than normal
                        <li>Fasting blood glucose is sugar level measured after fasting for a certain period. (such as overnight)</li>

                <strong>Types of Diabetes melitus:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Type 1 DM:   -  results to complete or near total lack of insulin so that their 
                        regime of management requires lifetime insulin admnistration</li>
                    <li>Type 2 DM:   -  a group 
                        of disorders characterized by variable degrees of insulin resistance, 
                        impaired insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose production.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
 <p>The expected values for normal fasting blood glucose concentration are between 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).</p>       
<p>When fasting blood glucose is between 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) changes in lifestyle and monitoring glycemia 
    are recommended. If fasting blood glucose is 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, diabetes is diagnosed.</p> 
     <p>An individual with low fasting blood glucose concentration (hypoglycemia) – below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) – 
     will experience <em>dizziness, sweating, palpitations, blurred vision </em> and other symptoms that have to be monitored and corrected</p>
     Increased fasting blood glucose concentration (hyperglycemia) is an indicator of a higher risk to diabetes. 
    <p>An individual’s fasting blood plasma glucose (FPG) may be in the normal range because the individual is not diabetic 
     or because of effective treatment with glucose-lowering medication in diabetics. Mean FPG at the national level 
    is used as a proxy for both promotion of healthy diets and behaviours and, treatment of diabetes.</p>
 <P>Hyperglacaemia is confirmed when values are above 5.6 mmol/l. But for diabetic patients, this level could be higher usually </P>
<p>Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are preceded by a period of progressive 
    worsening of glucose homeostasis, followed by the development of 
    hyperglycemia</p>



    <h2>Overview of type 1 DM</h2>
    <p>Type 1 diabetes affects approximately 5% to 10% of all people 
        with diabetes. It usually has an acute onset before 30 years of 
        age (DA, 2015) and is characterised by destruction of the pancreatic beta cells due to a 
        combination of genetic, immunological, epigenetic and environmental factors. In genetically 
        susceptible children compliance to early infant feeding is a 
        possible way to reduce type 1 diabetes.</p>
        <p>Although the events that precipitate beta-cell destruction 
            are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that a genetic 
            susceptibility is a common underlying factor in the development of type 1 diabetes.
             People do not inherit type 1 diabetes 
            itself; rather, they inherit a <b>genetic predisposition to type 1 
            diabetes</b>, which might be triggered by environmental factors</p>
            <p>The destruction of the beta cells results in decreased insulin production, unchecked glucose production
                 by the liver, 
                and fasting hyperglycaemia. In addition, glucose derived from 
                food cannot be stored in the liver and remains in the bloodstream and 
                contributes to postprandial (after meal) hyperglycaemia. <p>If the concentration of glucose in the blood exceeds 
                the renal threshold for glucose, usually 9 to 11 mmol/L, the 
                kidneys may not reabsorb all of the filtered glucose, and glucose appears in the urine (glucosuria). 
                When excess glucose is 
                excreted in the urine, it is accompanied by excessive loss of 
                fluids and electrolytes, which is called osmotic diuresis. 
                Insulin inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. </p>In 
                people with insulin deficiency, these processes are not unrestrained and contribute to hyperglycaemia. 
                In addition, the 
                breakdown of fatty acids results in increased production of 
                ketone bodies, which lead to ketoacidotic states and death if 
                the insulin deficiency is not corrected. </p>
