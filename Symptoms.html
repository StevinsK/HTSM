    <p>Clinical manifestations of all types of diabetes include the 
'three Ps': <b>polyuria</b> <i>(increased urination)</i>, <b>polydipsia </b>
<i>(increased thirst)</i> and <b>polyphagia</b> <i>(increased appetite).</i> </p><p>However, people with type 2 diabetes 
    can present with few, if any, 
symptoms. </p><p>Polyuria results in excess fluid loss through 
osmotic diuresis. Polydipsia occurs because of the thirst triggered by osmotic fluid loss and dehydration. Polyphagia 
(increased appetite) results from the catabolic state induced 
by insulin deficiency and the breakdown of proteins and fats.</p> 
<p>Other symptoms include fatigue and weakness, vision 
changes, dry skin, skin lesions or wounds that are slow to 
heal, and recurrent infections. </p>
<p>The onset of type 1 diabetes is usually sudden, although 
there is usually a prolonged prodromal phase as beta cell loss 
occurs. Type 1 is usually associated with sudden weight loss, 
and polyuria and polydipsia are common. Other signs include 
nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain if DKA develops.</p>

<h1>ACUTE COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES </h1>
<p>There are three major acute complications of diabetes and are 
    related to short-term imbalances in blood glucose levels: 
    <em>hypoglycaemia, DKA</em> and<em> syndrome HHS.</em></p>
    <h2>Hypoglycaemia</h2>
    <p>Hypoglycaemia <i>(abnormally low blood glucose level)</i> 
        occurs when the blood glucose falls lower than 3.3 mmol/L 
        due to too much insulin or other antidiabetic agents, too 
        little food, or excessive physical activity.</p><p> Hypoglycaemia 
        can occur at any time of the day or night.</p><p>It often occurs 
        before meals, especially if meals are delayed or snacks are 
        omitted. For example, mid-morning hypoglycaemia can 
        occur when the morning regular insulin is peaking, whereas 
        hypoglycaemia that occurs in the late afternoon coincides 
        with the peak of the morning intermediate-, premixed or 
        long-acting insulin.</p> <p>Middle of the night hypoglycaemia 
        may be due to peaking evening or predinner intermediateacting or premixed insulins, especially if the person has a 
        low blood glucose at bedtime and does not eat a snack. It 
        can also occur during exercise and several hours after 
        strenuous exercise.</p>
  
        <h3><i>Hypoglycaemia as a concern in older people:</i></h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Older people frequently live alone and may not recognise 
                the symptoms of hypoglycaemia </li>
                <li>Neuroglycopenic signs predominate and can be attributed 
                to cognitive impairment and forgetfulness </li>
                <li>Cognitive impairment may affect their self-care ability </li>
               <li> Renal impairment, which delays excretion of oral antidiabetic agents by the kidneys, means that they accumulate 
                in the blood </li>
                <li>Liver problems affect medicine detoxification </li>
                <li>They may be malnourished, which affects glycogen stores 
                and ability to mount a counter-regulatory response </li>
                <li>They may miss meals due to decreased appetite, poor dentition, financial reasons, or they cannot read food labels or 
                do not like the food while in the hospital or aged care 
                facilities </li>
                <li>Vision deficits and other functional problems can lead to 
                insulin dose errors.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>It may be safer for an older person to have a higher blood 
            glucose target range, for example, 4 to 11 mmol/L because of 
            the significant risks associated with hypoglycaemia.  </p><p>They may need safety alert devices 
            especially if they live alone to improve safety.</p>
            <h4><i>What are the manifestations hypoglycaemia?</i></h4>
            <P>The clinical presentations of hypoglycaemia are grouped into 
            two categories: 
            <ul><li>adrenergic symptoms </li><li>and neuroglycopenic 
            symptoms. </li></ul></P><p><i>For adrenergic symptoms means;</i>as the blood glucose level falls, the sympathetic 
            nervous system is stimulated, resulting in a surge of adrenaline 
            and noradrenaline, which causes symptoms such as sweating, 
            tremor, tachycardia, palpitation, nervousness and hunger and 
            is known as mild hypoglycaemia.</p> <P>These symptoms are often 
            missed if the person has hypoglycaemic unawareness, dementia or conditions such as Parkinson's disease.</P>
        <P>If mild hypoglycaemia is not corrected, the blood glucose 
            continues to fall, depriving the brain cells of glucose it needs 
            to function. </P><P> <i>Neuroglycopenic signs develop late presentations: which are;</i>  inability to concentrate, headache,
                 light-headedness, confusion, memory 
            lapses, numbness of the lips and tongue, slurred speech, 
            impaired coordination (falls and trauma risk, especially in 
            older people), emotional changes, irrational or combative 
            behaviour, vision changes and drowsiness.</p><p> Any combination 
            of these symptoms in addition to adrenergic symptoms can 
            be present. </p>
        <p>In severe hypoglycaemia, CNS function is so impaired that 
            the individual requires assistance from another person to 
            treat the hypoglycaemia. Symptoms of severe hypoglycaemia 
            are disoriented behaviour, seizures, difficulty arousing from 
            sleep, or loss of consciousness. </P>
            


<strong>Note</strong>
            <p><em>It is important to check the blood glucose level and 
            correlate it with symptoms. If the blood 
            glucose level is low, but not exhibiting any symptoms, 
            you should double-check the glucose level to ensure that 
            it is correct.</em> </p>
